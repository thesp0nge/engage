# Engage - your application security portal

Engage is a web portal used to keep track about security assessment requested
in your organization and the related exposures they were found.

The project goal is to have a centralized dashboard to keep track about
security assessment started in your organization, the exposures eventually
found (with the basic life cycle management tasks) and some gotchas to execute
your devsecops workout.
